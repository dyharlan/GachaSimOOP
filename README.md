# Gacha Simulator Framework (Object Oriented Edition).
 A terrible Gacha Simulator Framework for a Terrible Game Genre.
 
 The example code simulates a genshin impact roll session. 
 This is more of a coding exercise for me during my college java classes. This program might improve as I get
 better with java and programming in general.

 The version in this repository is more up-to-date than the other one. Where certain OOP Concepts are applied. (Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction).
 Anyone could essentially create their own banner using the abstract class provided. It's up to developer to curate the algorithm for the roll session, and how rarity is determined.
 The Gacha Pool is still one big blob shared by all banner classes.

 For now, only the cli frontend is implemented. Fortunately it's quite easy to create a frontend. 
 
 TODO:
- Implement Fate Points (Genshin, could be too complex to be worth.)
- Breakdown the GachaPool class into smaller pieces. (idk what i'm talking about here.)
~~- Improve the UI Design.~~
~~- Make sure that the Gacha Pool isn't hardcoded anymore. Preferrably, it should be loaded from a file for larger gacha games.~~
